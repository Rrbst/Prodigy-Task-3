Overview of the Project

PROJECT : Predicting Customer Purchases Using a Decision Tree Classifier

Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a decision tree classifier that predicts whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. By analyzing factors like age, income, education level, and previous marketing interactions, the model will provide insights into customer behavior and assist in targeted marketing strategies.

Dataset: Bank Marketing Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
Features:
Demographic data: Age, job, marital status, education.
Behavioral data: Contact type, number of previous campaigns, previous outcomes.
Target variable: y (binary: "yes" = customer purchased, "no" = customer did not purchase).
Steps Involved
Data Collection and Understanding:

Load the Bank Marketing dataset.
Inspect the dataset to understand the structure, features, and target variable.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, if any.
Encode categorical variables using label encoding or one-hot encoding.
Normalize or standardize numerical features if required.
Feature Selection:

Analyze correlations and feature importance.
Retain relevant features that influence the target variable.
Model Development:

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train a decision tree classifier using the training data.
Tune hyperparameters such as tree depth, minimum samples per split, and criterion (e.g., Gini impurity or entropy).
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model on the test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.
Visualize the decision tree for interpretability.
Insights and Interpretation:

Identify key factors influencing customer decisions (e.g., education level, contact method).
Provide actionable recommendations for marketing strategies.
Tools and Libraries
Python: For programming.
Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: For implementing the decision tree classifier.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For visualizing results and the decision tree.
